# API documentation

All published study data in the app should be downloadable at several different granularities:

1. Full study metadata and uploaded data spreadsheet for batch downloads under [/static/export](https://mgrowthdb.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/static/export/).
2. Export UI with selectable bioreplicates per-study under `/study/<studyId>/export`, for example: [SMGDB00000001/export](https://mgrowthdb.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/study/SMGDB00000001/export/)).
3. Fine-grained API access to entities through their ID or by performing a search.

The following document describes the third functionality, fine-grained API access. To learn more about the first two, take a look at the user documentation in the help files in the "[Downloading Data](https://mgrowthdb.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/help/downloading-data/)" topic.

For the following examples, we'll use curl to demonstrate responses. We'll use a `$ROOT_URL` that could be set to your localhost installation, or could be the public database:

```bash
export ROOT_URL="https://mgrowthdb.gbiomed.kuleuven.be"
```

The JSON output will be formatted for readability and in some places, truncated with a message like `"[...N more entries...]"`. There will be a general "output structure" description that describes the general shape of the JSON with the types of its fields.

Requests for specific global identifiers like `SMGDB00000001` or `EMGDB000000026` should work for you as well, so you should be able to replicate them by running them in the console. NCBI IDs and ChEBI IDs should also work for you. However, other numeric ids may be different, since updates to the underlying data might force them to be recreated. Try these out by fetching a specific study or experiment and picking bioreplicate ID or measurement context ID from the public entity's metadata.

## General principles

There are two types of results from the API:

- Metadata returned as JSON
- Measurement data returned in CSV format

The JSON endpoints always end in `.json` and the CSV ones end in `.csv`. A single entity might be downloadable in either format if you simply change the suffix. Explore the specific examples below.

The `measurementTimeUnits` key describes what time units measurements will be fetched in from the CSV endpoints. Right now, the API will always return time in hours ("h"), but this might be a configurable option later. For the moment, you can consider this an informational key, rather than something specific to the particular study or experiment.

Successful results will be returned with an HTTP status code of `200`. A request that somehow doesn't fit the requirements of the API will have a response code of `400` ("bad request"). A request for a missing entity will return the code `404` ("not found"). For a JSON endpoint, the body of an unsuccessful response will have an "error" key that describes the issue. For a CSV endpoint, you can expect an error message as a single line of text.

## Types of values

Decimal values will be encoded as strings, since JSON doesn't technically support floating-point values.

Timestamps are encoded as ISO 8601-formatted strings. All timestamps should be in UTC (timezone +00:00). In the structure descriptions below, they'll be indicated as `datetime`.

Public IDs of studies, experiments, and projects, are also strings, but have a specific structure, a zero-padded number prefixed by "SMGDB", "EMGDB", and "PMGDB", respectively

Technique units depend on what the specific technique is, but they will be one of:

- Cell count units: Cells/mL, Cells/μL
- CFU count units: CFUs/mL, CFUs/μL
- Metabolite units of molar or mass concentration: mM, μM, nM, pM, g/L, mg/L

Units within these three lists are convertible between each other in the application, though at the moment the API returns the data in the units that it was uploaded in. There are also other units that are not convertible with the others:

- AUC: for metabolites, a relative measurement
- g/L: for mass concentration of cells, same unit as with metabolites, but non-convertible (since we don't know the weights of individual cells)
- reads: for relative cell abundances
- an empty string, indicating a unitless value like OD or pH.

Below, in the structure descriptions, these will be described as the type `Unit`.

## Search

You can use the "search" endpoint to locate studies with specific properties. At this time, you can only look for studies that measure specific **microbial strains** or measure specific **metabolites**. Output structure:

```typescript
{
  studies: string[],
  experiments: string[],
  measurementTimeUnits: "h",
  measurementContexts: [{
    id: number,
    experimentId: "EMGDBxxx",
    studyId: "SMGDBxxx",
    techniqueType: "fc"|"od"|"plates"|"16s"|"qpcr"|"ph"|"metabolite",
    techniqueUnits: Unit,
    subject: {
      type: "bioreplicate"|"strain"|"metabolite",
      name: string,
      NCBId?: number,
      chebiId?: number,
    }
  }]
}
```

Example search query that looks for the strain with NCBI Taxonomy ID 411483, [Faecalibacterium duncaniae](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/taxonomy/411483/):

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/search.json?strainNcbiIds=411483"
```

Output:

```json
{
  "studies": [
    "SMGDB00000004",
    "SMGDB00000005"
  ],
  "experiments": [
    "EMGDB000000026",
    "EMGDB000000028",
    "EMGDB000000031",
    "EMGDB000000032",
    "EMGDB000000033",
    "EMGDB000000042",
    "EMGDB000000043"
  ],
  "measurementTimeUnits": "h",
  "measurementContexts": [
    {
      "id": 3478,
      "experimentId": "EMGDB000000028",
      "studyId": "SMGDB00000004",
      "techniqueType": "qpcr",
      "techniqueUnits": "Cells/mL",
      "subject": {
        "type": "strain",
        "name": "Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165",
        "NCBId": 411483
      }
    },
    ["...13 more entries..."],
    {
      "id": 5256,
      "experimentId": "EMGDB000000042",
      "studyId": "SMGDB00000005",
      "techniqueType": "fc",
      "techniqueUnits": "Cells/μL",
      "subject": {
        "type": "strain",
        "name": "Faecalibacterium duncaniae",
        "NCBId": 411483
      }
    },
    ["...17 more entries..."]
  ]
}
```

The results include the public identifiers of studies and experiments that include measurements of that strain. You can dig into their details with the additional API calls described below.

The `measurementContexts` array includes the metadata of the measurement contexts that include the strain. You can iterate over the returned data and filter it additionally based on technique, measurement units, and so on.

Example 2: Searching by metabolite, in this case [N-acetylneuraminic acid](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/CHEBI:17012) with ChEBI ID 17012:

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/search.json?metaboliteChebiIds=17012"
```

```json
{
  "studies": [
    "SMGDB00000002"
  ],
  "experiments": [
    "EMGDB000000021",
    "EMGDB000000023"
  ],
  "measurementTimeUnits": "h",
  "measurementContexts": [
    {
      "id": 3107,
      "experimentId": "EMGDB000000021",
      "studyId": "SMGDB00000002",
      "techniqueType": "metabolite",
      "techniqueUnits": "mM",
      "subject": {
        "type": "metabolite",
        "name": "N-acetylneuraminic acid",
        "chebiId": 17012
      }
    },
    ["...7 more entries..."]
  ]
}
```

If you make a request for both strain and metabolite, the results will be the combination of both. In other words, the query will end up creating an `OR` operation. In practice, it might be best to make individual queries and process the results after downloading.

Note that the query terms are plural, `strainNcbiIds` and `metaboliteChebiIds`. You can make requests for multiple strains or metabolites by separating them with commas, for example:

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/search.json?strainNcbiIds=411483,536231&metaboliteChebiIds=17234,17012"
```

Again, the result will be an OR operation, where records associated with any of the given search queries will be included. In this case, any measurements of [Faecalibacterium prausnitzii](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/taxonomy/411483/), [Roseburia intestinalis L1-82](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/taxonomy/536231/), [glucose](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/CHEBI:17234), or [trehalose](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/CHEBI:27082).

}
```

## Measurement data

### For a single measurement context

From one of the above measurement context records, we can find the id of a particular collection of measurements and fetch its metadata as JSON and its specific measurements in CSV format.

Metadata structure:

```typescript
{
  id: number,
  experimentId: "EMGDBxxx",
  studyId: "SMGDBxxx",
  bioreplicateId: number,
  bioreplicateName: string,
  techniqueType: "fc"|"od"|"plates"|"16s"|"qpcr"|"ph"|"metabolite",
  techniqueUnits: Unit,
  subject: {
    type: "bioreplicate"|"strain"|"metabolite",
    name: string,
    NCBId?: number,
    chebiId?: number,
  },
  measurementCount: number,
  measurementTimeUnits: "h",
}
```

To fetch the metadata via curl:

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/measurement-context/1440.json"
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "id": 1440,
  "experimentId": "EMGDB000000020",
  "studyId": "SMGDB00000002",
  "bioreplicateId": 60329,
  "bioreplicateName": "Average(BT_WC)",
  "techniqueType": "fc",
  "techniqueUnits": "Cells/μL",
  "subject": {
    "type": "strain",
    "name": "Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482",
    "NCBId": 226186
  },
  "measurementCount": 14,
  "measurementTimeUnits": "h"
}
```

This gives us information about the specifics of the measurement context like what its technique is, what units the value is measured in, and the public ids of its containing experiment and study. To fetch the full dataset for this measurement context with "time" measured in hours:

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/measurement-context/1440.csv"
```

Example output:

```csv
time,value,std
0.0,2619.0,477.072
4.0,36072.333,1522.018
12.0,1003028.333,30201.503
16.0,1106725.0,85176.706
24.0,857815.0,62848.275
28.0,778893.333,47670.388
32.0,962915.0,55489.511
38.0,675345.0,26650.222
48.0,348478.333,102905.344
60.0,111021.667,28523.155
72.0,45606.667,13966.714
96.0,13413.333,4155.786
120.0,3215.0,461.808
```

If the measurement context does not have standard deviation values, the "std" column will be present, but empty. Example measurement and its data:

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/measurement-context/1314.json"
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/measurement-context/1314.csv"
```

```json
{
  "id": 1314,
  "experimentId": "EMGDB000000020",
  "studyId": "SMGDB00000002",
  "bioreplicateId": 60315,
  "bioreplicateName": "BT_WC_3",
  "techniqueType": "metabolite",
  "techniqueUnits": "mM",
  "subject": {
    "type": "metabolite",
    "name": "succinate",
    "chebiId": 26806
  },
  "measurementCount": 14,
  "measurementTimeUnits": "h"
}
```

```csv
time,value,std
0.0,0.57,
4.0,0.53,
8.0,2.19,
12.0,5.04,
16.0,7.67,
24.0,9.58,
28.0,10.66,
32.0,10.67,
38.0,10.69,
48.0,10.99,
60.0,11.06,
72.0,10.94,
96.0,11.0,
120.0,11.03,
```

### For an entire biological replicate

We can perform similar queries for biological replicates, getting the results for multiple measurement contexts in one CSV, grouped by measurement context id. We can get the bioreplicate IDs from the experiment metadata and use them to fetch either the bioreplicate-specific metadata or the measurements in CSV form.

Output structure:

```typescript
{
  id: number,
  experimentId: "EMGDBxxx",
  studyId: "SMGDBxxx",
  name: string,
  biosampleUrl: null,
  isAverage: boolean,
  measurementTimeUnits: "h",
  measurementContexts: [{
    id: number,
    techniqueType: "fc"|"od"|"plates"|"16s"|"qpcr"|"ph"|"metabolite",
    techniqueUnits: Unit,
    subject: {
      type: "bioreplicate"|"strain"|"metabolite",
      name: string,
      NCBId?: number,
      chebiId?: number,
    }
  }]
}
```

The CSV for a biological replicate includes additional context about the subject of each measurement: its type and name, and external database identifier, if applicable. This information can be seen in the JSON metadata, but it's included in the CSV for convenience.

```bash
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/bioreplicate/1314.json"
curl -s "$ROOT_URL/api/v1/bioreplicate/1314.csv"
```

```json
{
  "id": 60332,
  "experimentId": "EMGDB000000023",
  "studyId": "SMGDB00000002",
  "name": "Average(BTRI_MUCIN)",
  "biosampleUrl": null,
  "isAverage": true,
  "measurementTimeUnits": "h",
  "measurementContexts": [
    {
      "id": 3364,
      "techniqueType": "od",
      "techniqueUnits": "",
      "subject": {
        "type": "bioreplicate",
        "name": "Average(BTRI_MUCIN)"
      }
    },
    ["...17 more entries..."]
  ]
}
